# Final Project: Quality of Life Analysis

Project Members: Evyn and Salvador

This project constructs a consolidated database merging Happiness, Freedom, and Economic data to analyze global quality of life. 

The repository contains:
1. **The Database:** A SQL dump (`project_qol.sql`) to set up the schema.
2. **The Assignment:** An HTML file (`homework_assignment.html`) containing the problems we designed.
3. **The Solutions:** Markdown files (`Prob1.md`, etc.) containing the SQL solutions to those problems.
4. **The Presentation:** Slides explaining our methodology.

**To begin:**
1. Download `project_qol.sql` and run it in your postgres terminal (`psql -d analysis -f project_qol.sql`).
2. Open `hw11-finalproject.html` to view the questions.
3. Review the solution files below for the answer key.
